### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a third-year student pursuing a major in Statistics and a minor in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Toronto. Everyday, I work with data, which happens to be my greatest passion. I ultimately plan to make a career out of it, whether it is data science, data analysis, or more. Beyond data, Iâ€™m interested in music, film, and fashion as I find their self-expression and creativity to serve as inspiration for me.
