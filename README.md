### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m a recent graduate from the University of Torontoa with a major in Statistics and a minor in Computer Science and Mathematics. Everyday, I work with data, which happens to be my greatest passion. I ultimately plan to make a career out of it, whether it is data science, data analysis, or more. Beyond data, I’m interested in music, film, and fashion as I find their self-expression and creativity to serve as inspiration for me.
